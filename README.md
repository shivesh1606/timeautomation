This project is a Python project that requires setting up a virtual environment and running the start.py file.

##Setting up Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies from the system-level Python installation. Follow these steps to set up a virtual environment:

##Install virtualenv package using pip by running the following command:
Copy code
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
Copy code
```
virtualenv venv
This command will create a new directory named venv that will contain a new Python environment.
```
##Activating Virtual Environment
```Before running the start.py file, you need to activate the virtual environment. Follow these steps to activate the virtual environment:

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate

Once activated, the virtual environment's name will appear in the terminal prompt.
```
###To install the project's dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file, activate the virtual environment and run the following command in the project directory:
```
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
```
###Running the File
```After activating the virtual environment, you can run the start.py file. Follow these steps to run the file:

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to start the program:

Copy code
python tinkter.py
This command will execute the start.py file and the program will start running.
```
###Deactivating Virtual Environment
After you are done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment. Follow these steps to deactivate the virtual environment:

Run the following command:
```Copy code
deactivate
This command will deactivate the virtual environment and return you to the system-level Python installation.
```
Note: It is recommended to reactivate the virtual environment before working on the project again.
